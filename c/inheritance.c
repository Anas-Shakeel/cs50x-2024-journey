/*
Implementation Details:
`create_family()` takes an int (generation) as input and should allocate
one person for each member of the family of that number of generations,
returning a pointer to the person in the youngest generation.

    - For example,  `create_family(3)` should return a pointer to a person with
    two parents, where each parent also has two parents.

    - Each `person` should have `alleles` assigned to them. The oldest generation
    should have alleles randomly chosen (as by calling `random_allele`), and
    younger generations should inherit one allele (chosen at random)
    from each parent.

    - Each `person` should have parents assigned to them. the oldest generation
    should have both `parents` set to `NULL`, and younger generations should
    have `parents` be an array of two pointers, each pointing
    to a different parent.

TODO
- Implement the `create_family` & `free_family` functions.

`create_family`:
should return a pointer to a person who has inherited their blood type from
    a number of generations:

    - Notice first that this problem poses for a good opportunity for recursion!
        - To determine the present person's blood type, you need to first
        determine their parent's blood types.
        - To determine those parent's blood types, you must first determine their
        parent's blood types, And so on until you each the generation you wish
        to simulate.


`free_family`:
Should recusivley free all `malloc`ked memory (persons) to avoid memory leaks.
    - Since this is a recursive function, you should first handle the base case.
    if the input to the function is NULL, then there's nothing to free, and return.
    - Otherwise, free both parents first and then free the child.
