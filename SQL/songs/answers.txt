To characterize the audio aura of listeners, we would need to analyze the average energy, valence, and danceability of those songs. These analyzations provide insights into the overall mood, positivity, and rhythm of the listener's music taste.

Characterization of the Audio Aura:
Energy:
    High-energy songs typically have fast tempos, intense beats, and loud instrumentation. A high average energy score suggests the listener enjoys music that is energetic and dynamic.

Valence:
    Valence measures the positivity or negativity of music. A high valence score indicates that the listener's top songs are positive and happy.

Danceability:
    Danceability shows how suitable a song is for dancing based on its rhythm, tempo, and beat strength. A high danceability score implies that the listener's favorite songs are likely to be rhythmic and easy to dance.

Hypothesis:
    While calculating the audio aura based on average energy, valence, and danceability provides some insights into the listener's music preferences, it may not capture the full complexity of their musical taste.

    Music is subjective, and listeners may have diverse preferences that cannot be fully captured by these three metrics alone.

    The top 100 songs from 2018 may not accurately represent the listener's current musical preferences or mood, as their tastes may have evolved over time.

Proposed Improvements:
    Genre Analysis:
        Instead of focusing just on energy, valence and danceability we could analyze the distribution of genres within the listener's top songs. This would provide more understanding of their music taste and mood.

    AI:
        Utilizing AI trained on larger datasets could offer more accurate predictions of a listener's audio aura by considering a broader range of features and patterns in their music listening behavior.
